publication: Geometric-Based Passive Bearing-Only Localization Model for UAV Flight
publication_short: IEEE

Research Focus: To achieve pure azimuth passive localization, facilitating effective adjustments within UAV formations. This study, grounded in geometric principles, categorizes potential scenarios and establishes corresponding pure azimuth passive localization models, while also proposing solutions for positional adjustments.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Personal Contribution:Through rigorous geometric derivations, this analysis categorizes various scenarios; introduces pure azimuth passive localization models, laying a theoretical foundation for UAV formation positioning; develops multiple positional adjustment schemes to meet practical in-flight requirements; conducts error analysis to assess the precision and reliability of the positioning model; and, ultimately, as the primary author, completes the initial draft of the paper.
