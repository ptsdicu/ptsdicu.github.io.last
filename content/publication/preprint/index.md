Research Focus: Utilizing the ARIMA time series model for data forecasting, this study also employs the second-order differencing method to evaluate the effects before and after the implementation of specific policies. Additionally, the project involves the use of differential equations to describe population growth trends, incorporating real-world scenarios to enhance the visualization of population changes pre- and post-policy implementation.

Personal Contribution: Conducted extensive review of English literature to identify research directions and gather relevant data; participated in the drafting and revision of the paper.
